Postal Submission Guide
=======================

If you are not comfortable with using the upload site, you can mail documents to one of the P.O. boxes in our secure postal network. We accept documents on digital media (USB drives, CD-ROMs) and physical documents. Submissions to our postal network offer a strong form of anonymity and are good for bulk truth-telling.

The recommendations in this document are adapted from Wikileak's guidelines on postal submission.

Steps
-----

1. First place your leak onto a CD, DVD or a USB Flash drive. If you only have paper documents, we will scan them if they are of significant political or media interest (if you are unsure whether this may be the case, please contact us first).
2. Post your information to one of our secure P.O. Boxes listed below. You may post to whatever P.O. Box on the list that you feel most suitable given the nature of the material and your postal service. P.O. Box addresses are subject to change.

A representative of Honest Appalachia will then process your submission. You can use whatever return address you like, but make doubly sure you have written the destination correctly as postal workers will not be able to return the envelope to you.

After receiving your postal submission our representatives upload the
data to Honest Appalachia and then destroy the mailed package.

High Risk Postal Submissions
----------------------------

If your leak is extremely high risk, you may wish to post away from your local post office at a location that has no witnesses or video monitoring.

Many CD and DVD writers will include the serial number of the DVD or CD writer onto the CD/DVDs they write. If the post is intercepted this information can in theory be used to track down the manufacturer and with their co-operation, the distributor, the sales agent and so on. Consider whether there are financial records connecting you to the CD/DVD writer sale if your adversary is capable of intercepting your letter to us and has the will to do this type of expensive investigation. Pay cash if you can for the CD/DVD writer.

Similarly, CD and DVD media themselves include a non-unique manufacturing "batch number" for each group of around 10,000 CD/DVDs made. Pay cash when buying the CD or DVD. Try to choose a store without video cameras at the register.

Although we are aware of no instances where the above has been successfully used to trace an individual, anti-piracy operations have used the information to trace piracy outfits who sell tens or hundreds of thousands of counterfeit CDs or DVDs.

If you post it to us, a good option is to encrypt the USB file/CD file and then contact us at a later date via our secure email with the encrypting passphrase. That way if the post is intercepted, the data cannot be copied.

If you suspect you are under physical surveillance, discreetly give the letter to a trusted friend or relative to post.
